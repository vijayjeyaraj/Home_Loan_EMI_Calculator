# Project Title:

## Dynamic Home Loan EMI Calculator Using Excel

# Description:

Developed a comprehensive Excel-based tool to dynamically calculate and compare monthly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) for home loans from five major Indian banks: HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis, and Kotak. This consolidated calculator allows users to compare home loan options from these banks in a single sheet, enhancing convenience and decision-making. Utilized advanced Excel functionalities like web scraping and Power Query for data automation, analysis, and visualization.

The tool extracts real-time interest rates directly from the banks' official websites, ensuring the calculations are always based on the latest data. Users can input their loan amount and tenure, and the tool dynamically updates to show the EMI for each bank. The results are presented in a clear, comparative format, allowing users to make informed decisions at a glance.
